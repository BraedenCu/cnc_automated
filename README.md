# The Project Goal

## General Project

Working on building a router (simulated) that, given a 3d shape, determines the optimal way to cut out stock around that intended shape as quickly as possible. The goal is that, given a piece stock and a target object to be milled out, the router will determine the ideal moves to cut out the stock necessary to be left with just the cylinder. I am beginning with a simulated environment. The implementation begins with developing a simulated 3D environment that represents both the stock and the target shape as voxel grids. The router is simulated as an agent that can remove material along its path, where each move is not confined to a simple linear displacement but can span multiple voxels and follow complex, non-linear trajectories. The router begins in the top corner of the grid. We train by generating random target shapes placed at the bottom of the grid. The job of the router is to cut out as much material around the target shape as quickly as possible, without hitting the target shape.
